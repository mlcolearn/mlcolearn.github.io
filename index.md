### About MLCoLearn

The meet-up happens in Bonn, every other week. 

A typical session begins with topic pitches, in which a speaker or group member presents a dataset, method, problem, or whatever they want to work on with the group. Attendees then work on or discuss whichever topic interests them the most. 

If you're curious about the kinds of topics we discuss, check out the code and materials from past sessions on the meet-up GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mlcolearn/mlcolearn-meetup-season1" class="visible-link">here.</a>
